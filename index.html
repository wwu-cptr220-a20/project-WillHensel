                <h2>What it's all about</h2>
                <p>
                    This app seeks to end the constant shuffle of board games while you're trying to find the right game to play
                    with your group. Existing solutions are often too simple, neglecting useful features like categorization and
                    advanced searching.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Board Game Organizer ties into the Board Game Atlas API, so you never have to worry about not finding your game
                    in our database. It also allows users to filter by mechanics, which can be useful for finding the right game for the
                    right group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this app you can input your games, rate them, add comments, and categorize them based on your preferences. Then,
                    when you have your group over to play a game, but haven't figured out which one, you can search based on the criteria
                    you created. In the comments, you could enter what group likes to play the game or what kind of playstyle it is, then
                    search by that criteria to find the perfect game for that night.
                </p>
                <h2>How is this different from Board Game Geeks?</h2>
                <p>
                    Board Game Geeks is arguably the biggest board game website. It includes a feature that allows you to enter your games
                    into a virtual collection and add custom comments. The difference lies in the features and presentation. Board Game Organizer
                    will allow you to browse the games in your library in an easier way, thanks to the categorization.
