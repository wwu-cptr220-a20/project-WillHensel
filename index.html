            <p>
                This app seeks to end the constant shuffle of board games while you're trying to find the right game to play
                with your group. Existing solutions are often too simple, neglecting useful features like categorization and
                advanced searching.
            </p>
            <p>
                Board Game Organizer ties into the Board Game Atlas API, so you never have to worry about not finding your game
                in our database. It also allows users to filter by mechanics, which can be useful for finding the right game for the
                right group.
